# Affine rainbow-four-cycle colorings

Research notes on restricted cases of Erdős problem #810 and an
oscillatory affine-operator estimate over prime fields.

## Setting

Let $`p`$ tend to infinity through odd primes. A color $`a`$ is a partial
affine map $`x\mapsto ax+\beta(a)`$, with one color per nonzero slope.
Assume that the resulting bipartite graph is simple, properly colored,
and every four-cycle is rainbow. Write $`D_a`$ for the actual row domain
of color $`a`$, and $`m=\sum_a|D_a|`$.

## Main results

### Bounded-VC supports

If the family $`\{D_a\}`$ has uniformly bounded VC dimension, then
$`m=o(p^2)`$, with arbitrary intercepts $`\beta(a)`$. The same conclusion
holds when the color–row incidence bigraph omits a fixed induced
bipartite pattern.

### Nearly common supports

If $`D_a\subseteq X`$ and $`\sum_a|X\setminus D_a|=o(p^2)`$, then
$`m=o(p^2)`$. For polynomial intercepts of fixed degree $`D\ge2`$,

```math
m\le C_Dp^{19/10}+\sqrt{2}\,p\sqrt{\sum_a|X\setminus D_a|}.
```

### Oscillatory affine operators

For $`s\ne0`$ and arbitrary complex weights $`|w(a)|\le1`$, the operator

```math
C_{s,w}f(x)=\sum_{a\ne0}w(a)e_p\!\left(s(a^2x+a^3)\right)f(ax+a^2)
```

satisfies

```math
\|C_{s,w}\|_{2\to2}=O(p^{7/8}).
```

An exact decomposition gives the same bound for the corresponding
two-dimensional crossed operator.

| Note | Contents |
|---|---|
| [Bounded-VC supports](bounded-vc-supports.md) | Thin limits, finite bracketing, and extraction of nearly complete support rectangles |
| [Common affine supports](common-affine-supports.md) | Arbitrary intercepts, the affine-energy estimate, group-table reduction, and an explicit common-support rate |
| [Polynomial affine supports](polynomial-affine-supports.md) | Crossed involutions, Fourier fourth moments, and a power saving |
| [Oscillatory affine operators](oscillatory-affine-operator.md) | Uniform weighted norm estimate and exact Fourier–character decomposition |

The bounded-VC result uses the common-support theorem. Its spectral
calculation is expanded in the polynomial-support note. The oscillatory
operator proof is self-contained and uses elementary quadratic Gauss
sums. Published inputs and their precise roles are cited in the notes.

## Status

These are analytic research proofs, not Lean-certified results.
Historical novelty has not been established, and external review is
pending. No solution of unrestricted Erdős #810, universal $`o(N^2)`$
bound, or new record is claimed.

The remaining obstacle is controlling arbitrary actual support sets.
A bound for each nonzero Fourier slice does not by itself justify
summing all slices without additional control of their coefficients.
